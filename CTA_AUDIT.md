## Conversion Funnel Strategy

### Primary Conversion Flow
```
1. Hero CTA Click → Analytics Event Fired
   ├─→ Start Enterprise Trial → /contact
   └─→ Schedule Enterprise Demo → /demos/entropy

2. Contact Form Submission → POST /api/contact
   ├─→ Analytics Event: lead_generation
   ├─→ Form Data Stored in Database
   └─→ Success Toast Notification

3. Optional Booking Flow
   └─→ Booking Dialog (after successful submission)
       └─→ Google Calendar Integration
```

### Secondary Conversion Paths
- **Service Pages** → Free Strategy Session Forms → `/api/contact`
- **Pricing Page** → Get Started CTAs → `/contact` (with tier context)
- **Blog CTAs** → Related Service Pages → Contact Forms

---

## Analytics Implementation

### Tracking Standards
All CTAs now implement consistent analytics tracking:

```typescript
trackEvent({
  category: 'engagement' | 'lead_generation',
  action: 'click' | 'submit',
  label: '<page>_<action_description>'
});
```

### Implemented Tracking Labels
- `hero_enterprise_trial` - Hero "Start Enterprise Trial" button
- `hero_schedule_demo` - Hero "Schedule Enterprise Demo" button
- `enterprise_consultation` - CTASection form submission
- `contact_form` - Main contact page form submission
- `conversational_ai` - Conversational AI service form

### Analytics Benefits
1. **Attribution Tracking** - Know which CTAs drive conversions
2. **A/B Testing Ready** - Can test different CTA copy/placement
3. **Funnel Analysis** - Track user journey from CTA to conversion
4. **ROI Measurement** - Measure effectiveness of each CTA
