REPLIT BUILDER — FUSION DATA CO (SERVICES + PRICING UPGRADE)

Do not modify global fonts, colors, spacing, or components. Reuse existing Section/Container/Card/Typography classes. No new CSS frameworks.

GLOBAL RULES

Preserve styling: inherit all typography and theme tokens from the platform.


Sandler color coding:

Pain/Risks = Red band


Info/Discovery = Yellow band


Good News/Solution/CTA = Green band
Use the site’s existing utility classes or color tokens; if tokens exist (e.g., text-success, bg-warning), use those. If not, reuse the subtle band component already used on other pages.



Navigation: add “Conversational AI” under Services/Solutions; ensure Pricing is in top-level nav (or keep current path if it already exists).


SEO: page titles and meta descriptions only; keep canonical structure.

1) PAGE: /services/conversational-ai

Create a new service page using existing layout components. Content below is final copy; do not change voice or brand styling—only slot text into cards/sections.

HERO (Solution/Good News – Green band)

H1: Conversational AI that Answers, Qualifies & Books — 24/7
Sub: ElevenLabs voice + Vapi telephony + OpenRouter multi-model routing. Phone and SMS that sound human, follow process, and put revenue on your calendar.

CTAs:

Primary: “Hear a Demo” (opens modal with sample audio URL placeholder)


Secondary: “See Pricing” → /pricing

SECTION: What It Does (Info – Yellow band)

Cards (3–6 across responsive):

Phone Agents — Inbound/outbound, greeting → intent → qualify → schedule/transfer → CRM summary.


SMS Agents — Instant replies, drip nurture, reminders, link delivery, two-way conversation.


Persona Control — System prompts + guardrails; tone locked to your brand.


Live Handoffs — Detect hot intent → warm transfer or priority alert.


Analytics — Transcripts, tags, conversion tracking, and KPI dashboards.


Compliance — Opt-in/opt-out, consent logging, call-record notices.

SECTION: How It Works (Info – Yellow band)

Two columns:

Column A: Voice (ElevenLabs + Vapi)

STT/TTS: low-latency recognition + lifelike voice.


Call flow: greeting → purpose detection → identity capture (name/phone/email) → CRM match/create → qualification (timeframe, budget, need) → booking/transfer → structured summary to CRM.


Handoffs: warm transfer; voicemail detection; callback scheduling.


Latency envelope: target <700ms turns for natural feel.


Guardrails: no PII beyond necessity; do-not-call handling; profanity/abuse fallback.


Column B: SMS

Instant response: receipt + value link.


Sequencing: day 1 follow-up, day 3 FAQ, day 7 booking incentive (STOP supported).


Short links & UTM: attributable outcomes; fraud checks for links.


Escalation: keyword “CALL” or “AGENT” triggers live follow-up.

SECTION: n8n Automations (Info → Solution transition – Yellow/Green)

What we automate (examples):

Lead Intake → Deal: enrich → score → SMS/email → calendar → Slack alert → CRM update.


Case/Ticketing: classify → assign owner → SLA timers → escalation → close loop.


Docs & E-Sign: generate PDF → e-sign → deliver → attach to CRM deal/contact.


RevOps Alerts: payment events → notify team → update dashboard.


Reliability patterns: retries, dead-letter queues, idempotent ops, structured logging, alerting, and runbooks.
SECTION: Sandler Method Alignment (Good News – Green band)

Pain (red): slow responses, dropped leads, inconsistent qualification.


Info (yellow): transcripts and tags reveal patterns; no guessing.


Good News (green): booked meetings, clean CRM, faster close cycles.

SECTION: Evaluation & Improvement (Info – Yellow band)

Weekly transcript reviews (top 10 wins/losses).


Prompt AB tests; routing tweaks by intent.


KPI ladder: contact → qualified → booked → showed → won.

2) PAGE: /services/multi-model-agents (Golf-Bag Presentation)

Use an accordion or slide-like sections (existing components). Keep styling identical to other service pages.

HERO (Info – Yellow band)

H1: The Golf Bag: Multi-Model AI with OpenRouter
Sub: There is no single “best model.” Pros pick the right club for the shot—task, distance, lie, wind… context, latency, cost, and determinism.
PRESENTATION (Slides/Accordions)

Slide 1 — The Mistake
People ask “What’s the best model?” That’s like walking onto a course with one club.

Slide 2 — The Bag (Concept)

Driver = broad exploration, long-form generation, ideation.


Long Irons = structured reasoning, step-wise planning, JSON outputs.


Mid Irons = tool calling, code, API/memory interaction.


Wedge = cleanup from a bad lie: noisy inputs, rewriting, extraction.


Putter = final polish: headlines, SMS, tight copy.


Slide 3 — The Lie (Data Condition)

Tight fairway (clean data) → irons; heavy rough (messy data) → wedge first.


Sand (ambiguous intent) → probe with short prompts; don’t over-swing.


Slide 4 — Distance (Context Length)

Long distance (big context) → model with longer context & cost control.


Short game (microcopy) → small, deterministic, fast.


Slide 5 — Wind (Latency & Cost)

Phone calls = wind in your face → pick low-latency models.


Batch jobs = tailwind → can use slower, cheaper models at scale.


Slide 6 — Angle (Determinism & Schema)

When downstream automations depend on structure, use models that obey JSON and function calls reliably.


Slide 7 — Club Fitting (Your Stack)

OpenRouter lets us route to the best “club” step-by-step inside one workflow.


We snapshot prompts + routing so results are reproducible.


Slide 8 — Shot Routine (Our Process)

Inspect lie (data). 2) Pick club (model). 3) Shot plan (prompt schema).


Swing (call). 5) Check landing (eval). 6) Adjust.


Slide 9 — Scorecard (Metrics)

Contact → Qualified → Booked → Show → Won; plus latency, cost/lead, accuracy.


Slide 10 — Caddy (Your Agent)

Your agent is the caddy that knows the bag, the course, and your swing.


Slide 11 — Hazards (Risks)

Hallucination, privacy, compliance. Mitigate with guardrails, redaction, and human review on high-risk steps.


Slide 12 — The Win

Multi-model routing beats single-model dogma—every time, on real revenue.


CTA (Green band): “Build My Multi-Model Agent” → /contact
3) PAGE: /pricing  (Cards using existing styling)

Implement pricing as data-driven JSON so Boss can edit numbers only. Keep your card component styles.

Render the JSON into your existing PricingCards component. Under the cards, add an FAQ accordion with:

“What’s included vs. usage?”


“How fast is setup?” (Typical: days for Launch)


“Can you work with our CRM?” (Yes—two-way sync)


“How do you evaluate quality?” (Transcripts, tags, conversions)

4) CROSS-LINKS & CTAS

On /services/conversational-ai and /services/multi-model-agents, add a sticky CTA in the sidebar/footer: “See Pricing → /pricing” and “Talk to Us → /contact”.


Add a mini-panel (Green band) on both pages summarizing Sandler ladder and KPIs.

5) ANALYTICS (light touch)

Fire events: view_conversational_ai, view_multimodel, view_pricing, cta_contact_click, cta_pricing_click.


No UI changes; use existing analytics integration.

6) CONTENT SNIPPETS (ready to paste into cards/sections)

Capabilities (bullet block):

Phone: greet → intent → ID capture → qualify → schedule/transfer → CRM summary


SMS: instant reply, drips, reminders, verified links


Persona/guardrails: brand tone, crosstalk handling, fallback phrases


Handoffs: warm transfer with context packet


Metrics: transcripts, tags, step conversion


Compliance: opt-in/opt-out, consent, redaction


n8n Reliability (bullet block):

Retries + backoff, dead-letter queues, idempotency keys


Structured logs + alerting, replay tooling


Secrets vaulted, least-privilege tokens, audit trails


Sandler Bands (short copy):

Red: “Leads wait, slip, and go cold.”


Yellow: “We expose bottlenecks with transcripts, tags, and KPIs.”


Green: “We answer, qualify, and book—automatically.”

7) DONE CHECKS

Fonts and colors unchanged globally.


New pages inherit the same spacing, cards, and typography.


Nav + breadcrumbs correct; pages indexed in sitemap.


CTAs point to /pricing and /contact.


Sandler color bands used only as existing components/tokens (no new CSS).

If you want real numbers changed for pricing later, we just edit the JSON. Want me to also drop ready-to-paste copy for each card/section directly into your repo files?
