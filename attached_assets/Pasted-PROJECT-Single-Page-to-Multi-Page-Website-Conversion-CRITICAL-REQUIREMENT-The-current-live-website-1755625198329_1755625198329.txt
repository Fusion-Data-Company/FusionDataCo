PROJECT: Single-Page to Multi-Page Website Conversion
CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: The current live website must remain fully functional throughout this process. No downtime, no broken features.
OBJECTIVE: Convert the existing single-page website into a properly structured multi-page site with seamless navigation.
PHASE 1 - ANALYSIS & INVENTORY

Conduct a comprehensive audit of the current website structure
Document ALL active URLs currently in the system
Identify all content sections that need to become separate pages
List all CSS files, JavaScript files, and dependencies
Map out the current navigation flow and user journey

PHASE 2 - PLANNING

Design the new multi-page architecture
Create a sitemap showing:

Homepage (streamlined, not requiring endless scrolling)
All subsidiary pages
Navigation hierarchy


Plan URL structure and any necessary redirects
Identify shared components (header, footer, navigation menu)

PHASE 3 - IMPLEMENTATION

Create the new page structure without disrupting the live site
Implement a responsive navigation system that works across all pages
Migrate content from the single page to appropriate dedicated pages
Ensure all CSS and JavaScript work correctly on each new page
Set up proper redirects from old anchor links to new page URLs
Test all internal links and navigation paths

PHASE 4 - QUALITY ASSURANCE
Before marking this task complete, verify:

 All pages load without errors
 Navigation menu appears and functions on every page
 CSS styling is consistent across all pages
 JavaScript functionality works on all pages
 Mobile responsiveness is maintained
 Page load times are acceptable
 All forms and interactive elements function properly
 SEO meta tags are properly set for each page

DELIVERABLES

Complete list of all current URLs
New sitemap with all pages
Fully functional multi-page website
Documentation of any changes made
List of any redirects implemented

NOTE: Do not report completion until you have personally tested every page, every link, and every feature. If you encounter any blocking issues with CSS, JavaScript, or other code, document the issue and implement a fix before proceeding.
