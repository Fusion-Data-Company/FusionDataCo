# 🔧 REPLIT BUILDER MEGA-PROMPT: Small Business Website Productization (Phase 3)

**Objective:**  
Build a full Replit web app for Fusion Data Co that turns the current homepage and concept system into a structured, live, and deployable website experience for **small business owners**. This site is not a template — it’s a guided sales system, a SaaS onboarding flow, and a service portal that explains, sells, and delivers Fusion’s core offerings clearly and interactively.

## 🧩 SECTION 1: SYSTEM-WIDE STRUCTURE & DATA REFACTORING

**Task:**  
Disperse all current homepage content into actual page routes matching the nav bar. All links in the header must now route to real pages.  
/ → Hero, general message, overview  
/small-business-owners → Primary sales funnel for small business SaaS product  
/real-estate, /medical, /trades → Custom vertical funnel pages, Sandler style  
/social-media → SaaS content campaign service page with trial conversion funnel  
/pricing → Pricing plans page for all services  
/contact → Form that writes to CRM  
/crm → Login-protected backend with dashboard, settings, and customer tools

**Replace all current placeholder blocks with scoped, actual content.** Pull content out of the homepage and insert into correct files/components/pages. Ensure every nav link works and routes to a working section of the site.

## 🧱 SECTION 2: SMALL BUSINESS OWNER FUNNEL PAGE

**Route:** /small-business-owners  
**Page Style:**  
Sandler Sales Strategy → Humanized, consultative layout  
Use dark UI with **ambient red glow** around the Pain section and **ambient green glow** around the Solution/ROI section.

**Page Sections:**

1. **Introduction (Empathetic tone):**  
   > “You didn’t start your business to become a web designer, a developer, or a tech wizard. You’re great at what you do — but your website, funnels, and CRM? They’re holding you back.”

2. **Pain Points (red ambient glow background):**  
   - “You’ve got a GoDaddy template from 2014 that never helped close a single deal.”  
   - “You have to call someone to update your website. They take a week. Or they ghost.”  
   - “You’re losing leads because your contact form breaks on mobile — again.”  
   - “Your social media page hasn’t been updated since last tax season. You’re not even visible.”  
   - “You don’t have time to become a tech expert. You’re running a real business.”

3. **Solution (green ambient glow):**  
   - Fully built website, funnel pages, forms  
   - CRM + lead storage in your own Postgres DB (you control it)  
   - 24/7 live support — a real person, any time  
   - Hosting, updates, content management — done for you  
   - Everything evolves with your business  
   - Month-to-month, no contracts

4. **CTA Section:**  
   - Register now form (Name, Email, Business Type, Phone)  
   - Writes to leads table in CRM  
   - Add field: “Which service are you most interested in?” (dropdown)

5. **ROI Calculator (New Component):**  
   - “How many leads do you get now?” [input]  
   - “What’s your average ticket price?” [input]  
   - “How many jobs/leads could you close with 20% more leads?” [output: projected $ gain]

## 📱 SECTION 3: SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN PAGE

**Route:** /social-media  
**Target Audience:** Business owners with barely-used Facebook/Instagram pages

**Offer:**
2-week free trial  
We post once per day  
Custom-tailored content based on their service & campaign  
After trial → paid tier starts at $199/mo

**Sections:**
The Pain: “Your business looks dead online — and prospects don’t trust what looks dead.”  
The Service: “We run your page. Relevant content. Consistent branding. No spam.”  
The Trial: Start posting now, get proof, then decide.  
Sign-up form: Writes to CRM, socialMediaTrial tag

## 💼 SECTION 4: CRM BACKEND (/crm)

Login-protected admin panel (use Supabase or Replit auth)  
Show cards for:
  - New Leads  
  - New Trial Signups  
  - Active Sites
Allow user to:
  - See submitted leads  
  - Tag and sort them  
  - See trial signups and form responses  
  - Access/update chat system prompt
Add Stripe connection for plan upgrades  
Embed form manager to view/edit forms connected to funnel pages

---

## 💬 SECTION 5: CONVERSATIONAL COPY STRATEGY

Rewrite all funnel content to read like a 1-on-1 **sales conversation**:
  - “I get it. You’re busy. You don’t have time to figure out some WordPress plugin jungle.”  
  - “This isn’t a template. It’s a business in a box — that evolves as you grow.”  
  - “You’ve got leads. They’re not going to wait while your tech catches up.”

Tone = Empathetic. Consultative. Assertive.  
Match Sandler tone, GoHighLevel pacing, and Apple/NVIDIA styling.

## 🛠 SECTION 6: FUNCTIONAL UPGRADES

Fix all contact/registration forms to:
  - POST to backend  
  - Write to CRM  
  - Validate inputs (email, required fields)  
  - Show success message or redirect to /thank-you

Add visual cues:
  - Red ambient glow around Pain sections  
  - Green glow + gradient buttons around ROI/CTA zones  
  - Glow is placed as a **separate component behind** the card (z-stack), never applied directly

Upgrade all cards:
  - Front: colored titanium (blue, black, silver)  
  - Shadows: white + black dropshadows for realism  
  - Ambient glow div behind card  
  - Responsive 3D motion on hover

Upgrade all buttons:
  - Titanium or chrome with animated hover gradients  
  - CTA buttons pulse subtly and animate on hover (shimmer, light line, etc.)

## 📦 SECTION 7: BACKEND FUNCTIONALITY

Write new submissions to correct Postgres tables:
  - leads (with source tags: smallbiz, realestate, etc.)  
  - contact_requests  
  - trials
Add timestamp, source page, and referrer  
If using Supabase, use Row Level Security and auth protection  
Optional: Send Telegram alert when a new lead is submitted

---

## 🔁 SECTION 8: REPEAT FOR INDUSTRY FUNNELS

Copy same sales layout and logic for:
/real-estate
/medical
/trades

Update pain points, use case copy, examples, and calls to action based on industry.  
Use actual examples from Upwork, Yelp complaints, or Google Business reviews.

---

## 🧠 SECTION 9: EXTRA FEATURES TO INCLUDE

Add interactive ROI calculator (on /small-business-owners and /social-media)  
Add comparison table: Fusion vs. Wix, GoDaddy, GoHighLevel  
Optional component: toggle switch — “How your funnel looks now” vs. “After Fusion”  
Chatbot: Ask if user has a website → respond based on yes/no, collect pain points

---

### ✅ FINAL INSTRUCTION:

> Execute the full upgrade. Organize the site by page and function. Eliminate all placeholders. Create clear sales flows per funnel. Use visuals, motion, ROI tools, forms, and colors to drive conversion. Do not stop unless a timeout occurs. Work continuously across all sections, forms, and pages. Treat this like a product launch for a Fortune 50 firm. Nothing basic. All polished. All real.
