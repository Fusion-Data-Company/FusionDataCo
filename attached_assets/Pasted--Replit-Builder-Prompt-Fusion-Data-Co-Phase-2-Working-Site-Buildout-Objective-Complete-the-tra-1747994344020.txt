💻 Replit Builder Prompt: Fusion Data Co – Phase 2 Working Site Buildout
Objective: Complete the transformation of the Fusion Data Co concept site into a fully functional SaaS platform front-end with correct content routing, styling, registration forms, and CRM connections.

🧼 1. VISUAL CORRECTIONS AND COLOR CONSISTENCY
Eliminate all green-tinted neon or pastel glow styles

Replace green hues with deep electric cobalt blue (HEX: #004CFF or similar)

All headers using FUSIONDATACO blue — keep this color consistent across H1s and CTA elements

Remove pink and pastel hues completely

Reduce glow/blur on all text:

Cap text-shadow to 0 0 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.3)

No outer glow or blur-heavy gradients

For buttons:

Background: flat cobalt blue

On hover: subtle glow (same blue, opacity 0.2), no shimmer trails unless elegant

Use subtle edge gradient or 1px border in a lighter cobalt if needed

🗂 2. PAGE STRUCTURE AND CONTENT SEPARATION
Migrate all homepage content into proper pages defined in NAV bar

Each page must have its own route, layout, and properly scoped content

NAV Bar Links → These must be real working pages:

/ – Homepage

/small-business-owners – Primary sales funnel

/real-estate, /medical, /trades – Industry-specific Sandler funnels

/social-media – Automation service plans and campaign builder

/pricing – SaaS tier structure + Stripe (or placeholder)

/contact – Contact form

/crm – Login-protected CRM dashboard

🔁 3. SANDLER-STYLE FUNNEL CONTENT FOR EACH INDUSTRY PAGE
Apply this structure to all funnel pages:

Introduction: Empathetic headline for the industry

Pain Points: Bullet list or short paragraphs specific to the vertical

Solution & ROI: Features Fusion solves + data-driven ROI examples

Call to Action: Embedded lead form (not linked) with full width

Route Assignments:

/small-business-owners → General business owners funnel

/real-estate → Realtors and brokers

/medical → Doctors, clinics, dentists

/trades → Plumbers, HVAC, electricians

Each form should:

Submit to backend

Write to CRM DB table leads

Include hidden input tag for funnel source (e.g. RealEstateFunnel)

🧾 4. PRICING PAGE BUILD
Route: /pricing

Include 3 Plans:

Starter – $49/mo

Growth – $149/mo

Elite – $399/mo

Plan cards: titanium UI, minimal styling

Feature grid beneath cards

Each card: “Start Free Trial” button → dummy link or Stripe placeholder

🛠 5. FORM CONNECTIONS
All forms on the site must:

POST to backend

Save entry in CRM table leads or contact_requests

Include name, email, phone (if applicable), source page, message

Add success message or redirect to /thank-you

🧠 6. CRM & AUTH GATE
Route: /crm

Add login form + gate using basic auth or placeholder

After login: show dummy dashboard with cards for:

Total Leads

Scheduled Posts

Recent Signups

Protect all routes /crm/* behind auth

🧭 7. ROUTING, NAVIGATION & FOOTER
NAV bar should:

Work on all screen sizes

Highlight active page

Link to live pages only (no placeholders or 404s)

Footer:

Include links to every page

Add Fusion copyright

📱 8. MOBILE RESPONSIVENESS
All pages must scale cleanly on:

iPhone 12+, Galaxy S22+, iPad

Test layout collapse for headers, forms, cards

Button spacing: at least 44px height

Inputs: fill full width on mobile

🧪 9. QA AND TESTING REQUIREMENTS
After build, verify:

All NAV links work

All forms submit and store entries

CRM access is restricted

Pages have correct content, not duplicated

Color styling is clean and consistent (no green/pink glow)

DO NOT ask for additional input during the build. Work through all routes, components, and content until the site is complete. Remove all placeholder content. Replace it with real copy per industry page. This is a working website, not a design prototype.

Proceed immediately. Run continuously. If timed out, resume without prompt. This is a full Phase 2 rollout.
Fusion Data Co is going enterprise live — get it done.
