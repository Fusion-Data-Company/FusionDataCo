## THE APEX2.0 PSYCHOLOGICAL ARCHITECTURE

### A - ATTENTION ARCHITECTURE
**Objective**: Hack the Reticular Activating System to break through content noise

```
ATTENTION = (Pattern Break √ó Curiosity Gap √ó Visual Impact) √∑ Cognitive Load
```

- **Temporal Anchoring**: Time-specific triggers ("In the next 24 hours...")
