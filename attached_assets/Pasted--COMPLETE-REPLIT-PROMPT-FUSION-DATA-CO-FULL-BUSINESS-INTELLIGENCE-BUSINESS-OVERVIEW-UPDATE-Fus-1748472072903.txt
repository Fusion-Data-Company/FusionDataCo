## UPDATED CONVERSATION STARTERS

**REPLACE THE CONVERSATION STARTERS ARRAY**:

```typescript
const conversationStarters = [
  "What's the biggest operational bottleneck slowing your business growth right now?",
  "How much time does your team waste on manual business processes each week?",
  "What's costing you the most money - poor website performance, scattered customer data, or inconsistent marketing?",
  "If you could automate one business process tomorrow, which would save you the most time and money?",
  "How much are you spending monthly on separate tools for website, CRM, email marketing, and social media?",
  "What's your most expensive business problem - customer management, lead generation, or content creation?",
  "How many different platforms do you juggle just to run your business operations?",
  "What would streamlining all your business operations into one platform be worth monthly?",
  "What's preventing your business from scaling - technology limitations or operational inefficiencies?",
  "If I could eliminate your biggest operational headache in 30 days, what would that be?"
];
```

## QUALIFICATION FLOW BY SERVICE TYPE

**ADD THIS LOGIC** to guide prospects to appropriate services:

```typescript
// Service matching logic based on pain points
const matchServiceToPain = (painPoint) => {
  const lowerPain = painPoint.toLowerCase();
  
  if (lowerPain.includes('social media') || lowerPain.includes('content') || lowerPain.includes('posting')) {
    return 'social_media';
  } else if (lowerPain.includes('website') || lowerPain.includes('ecommerce') || lowerPain.includes('online sales')) {
    return 'website';
  } else if (lowerPain.includes('crm') || lowerPain.includes('customer data') || lowerPain.includes('contact management')) {
    return 'crm';
  } else if (lowerPain.includes('leads') || lowerPain.includes('prospects') || lowerPain.includes('conversion')) {
    return 'lead_generation';
  } else if (lowerPain.includes('multiple tools') || lowerPain.includes('scattered') || lowerPain.includes('integration')) {
    return 'complete_platform';
  } else {
    return 'discovery_needed';
  }
};
```

## EXPECTED CONVERSATION FLOWS

**COMPLETE PLATFORM PROSPECT:**
Bot: "How much are you spending monthly on separate tools for website, CRM, email marketing, and social media?"
User: "Probably $800-1000 across 5 different platforms"
Bot: "That's expensive and inefficient. What's the biggest headache with managing all those separate systems?"
User: "Data doesn't sync, have to enter everything multiple times"
Bot: "Our white-label platform eliminates that completely - everything integrated into one system. Would you like to see how it works for businesses like yours?"

**SOCIAL MEDIA PROSPECT:**
Bot: "How much time does your team spend creating social media content weekly?"
User: "About 15 hours a week"
Bot: "That's expensive labor. How much is that costing you monthly in wages?"
User: "Maybe $1,200 in team time"
Bot: "What if I could cut that to 2 hours weekly with better results? Want to try our AI content system FREE for 2 weeks?"

**WEBSITE PROSPECT:**
Bot: "What's preventing your website from generating more leads or sales?"
User: "It's slow and doesn't convert well"
Bot: "How much revenue are you losing monthly to poor website performance?"
User: "Hard to say, maybe $5,000+"
Bot: "Our FANG-level websites with integrated CRM typically double conversion rates. What would that be worth to your business?"
