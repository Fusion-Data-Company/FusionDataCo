REPLIT BUILDER — FUSION DATA CO ELITE SERVICES + PRICING UPGRADE (MEGA PROMPT)

GLOBAL RULES

Do not alter global fonts, colors, spacing, or style system. Preserve Fusion Data Co.’s theme and typography exactly.


Use Sandler funnel bands as already implemented (red = Pain, yellow = Info, green = Good News/CTA).


Enterprise polish only: no hype, no fluff. Copy must sound credible to a CTO, COO, VP of Sales.


Cross-link every page: Services → Pricing → Contact.


Keep all UI components consistent with existing cards, grids, typography, and spacing.

HERO (Green band)

H1: Conversational AI that Answers, Qualifies & Books — 24/7


Sub: ElevenLabs voice + Vapi telephony + OpenRouter routing. Phone and SMS that sound human, follow process, and put revenue on your calendar.


CTAs:

“Hear a Demo” (modal with sample audio)


“See Pricing” → /pricing



What It Does (Yellow band — Cards)

Phone Agents — Inbound/outbound, greeting → intent → qualify → schedule/transfer → CRM summary.


SMS Agents — Instant replies, drip nurture, reminders, link delivery.


Persona Control — Guardrails ensure tone matches your brand.


Live Handoffs — Detect hot leads → transfer instantly with context.


Analytics — Transcripts, tagging, conversion dashboards.


Compliance — TCPA opt-in/out, call-record notices, consent logging.


How It Works (Two Columns)

Voice (ElevenLabs + Vapi):

STT/TTS with sub-second latency.


Call flow: greet → detect purpose → capture ID → CRM match → qualify → schedule/transfer → structured summary.


Warm transfer support, voicemail detection, callback scheduling.


Guardrails: profanity fallback, do-not-call checks, PII minimization.


SMS:

T+0: instant receipt & value link.


Day 1: tip + soft CTA.


Day 3: FAQ answer + booking link.


Day 7: incentive to schedule.


STOP/HELP required; consent logged.


Industry Examples (Enterprise polish)

Real Estate: Call → qualify buyer → auto-book showing.


Insurance: SMS → policy renewal reminder → payment link.


Healthcare: Phone → appointment booking → HIPAA consent note.


Finance: Loan pre-qualification → checklist delivery via SMS.


Metrics Framing

Avg. response time: <1 sec voice, <5 sec SMS.


Conversion lifts: +15–30% from instant follow-up.


Lead decay reduced: hours → seconds.


Sandler Alignment

Red (Pain): dropped calls, slow response, wasted leads.


Yellow (Info): transcripts & tags reveal bottlenecks.


Green (Good News): qualified, booked, and logged in CRM automatically.

2) PAGE: /services/multi-model-agents (Golf Bag)

HERO (Yellow band)

H1: Multi-Model AI Done Right — The Golf Bag Approach


Sub: Stop asking “What’s the best model?” The pro’s answer: “What’s the best model for this shot?”


Presentation (Accordion or Slides)

Slide 1 — The Mistake: Walking onto a course with one club = trying to run your business on one model.


Slide 2 — The Bag:

Driver = long-range generation (ads, blogs).


Irons = structured reasoning (sales scripts, workflows).


Wedge = cleanup/extraction (messy CRM notes).


Putter = final polish (headlines, SMS copy).



Slide 3 — The Lie (Data Condition): Clean data = fairway (easy shot). Messy data = rough (needs wedge first).


Slide 4 — Distance (Context): Long doc analysis = driver. Short CTA = putter.


Slide 5 — Wind (Latency/Cost): Phone calls = headwind → low latency models. Batch processing = tailwind → slower/cheaper models.


Slide 6 — Angle (Determinism): Compliance workflows = use JSON-locked models.


Slide 7 — Club Fitting: OpenRouter lets us choose the right model each step.


Slide 8 — Scorecard: Tied to funnel metrics → Contact → Qualified → Booked → Won.


Slide 9 — Hazards: Hallucination, privacy, compliance = “water/sand traps.” Mitigation = guardrails + redaction.


Slide 10 — The Win: Multi-model routing beats single-model hype in real revenue outcomes.


Industry Analogies (Enterprise polish)

Real Estate: Driver = generate 200 listing descriptions. Wedge = clean MLS data. Putter = polished Facebook ad copy.


Insurance: Irons = structured policy comparisons. Putter = personalized SMS renewal.


Finance: Wedge = normalize messy application docs. Driver = generate investor updates.


CTA (Green band): “Build My Multi-Model Agent” → /contact
