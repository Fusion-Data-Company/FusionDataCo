FEASIBILITY ASSESSMENT: REPLIT AUTH INTEGRATION FOR ADMIN PANEL

OBJECTIVE:
Analyze the feasibility of adding Replit Auth to the Admin Panel ONLY, without affecting any other part of the website. DO NOT IMPLEMENT ANYTHING - just provide a comprehensive plan and assessment.

RECONNAISSANCE REQUIREMENTS:

1. CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS:
   - Map out the existing admin authentication system
   - Identify how the admin panel is currently separated from public pages
   - Document all admin routes and endpoints
   - List current authentication methods and dependencies
   - Identify the technology stack (framework, language, architecture)

2. REPLIT AUTH COMPATIBILITY CHECK:
   - Verify if Replit Auth can be integrated with the current stack
   - Identify any potential conflicts with existing systems
   - Check if selective route protection is possible
   - Assess middleware capabilities for path-specific authentication

3. RISK ASSESSMENT:
   - What could break if we add Replit Auth?
   - Which files would need modification?
   - What are the chances of affecting public pages?
   - Are there any shared components between admin and public?
   - What dependencies might cause conflicts?

4. TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY:
   - Can Replit Auth be isolated to admin routes only?
   - Is the current architecture suitable for this separation?
   - What refactoring would be required?
   - Are there any blockers that make this impossible?

5. IMPLEMENTATION PATH (IF FEASIBLE):
   - Step-by-step approach to integration
   - List of files that would need changes
   - Estimated complexity and time required
   - Potential challenges and solutions
   - Rollback strategy if something goes wrong

DELIVERABLES:
1. Feasibility verdict: YES/NO with detailed reasoning
2. Complete technical assessment report
3. List of all potential risks and mitigation strategies
4. Detailed implementation plan (if feasible)
5. Alternative solutions if the primary approach isn't viable
6. Prerequisites that must be met before implementation
